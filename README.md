by Gene Ting-Chun Kao

**Result HTML page** can be found [here](https://genekao.github.io/udacity-build-a-portfolio-site/) in my github.io.

This portfolio is using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework, it is responsive web design so the layout will be adjusted according to the size of the web browser or screen.
